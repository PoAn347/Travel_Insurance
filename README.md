Predictive model for customer's purchasing

Travel insurance is a type of insurance policy that reimburses policyholders for money they lose from non-refundable deposits and payments when something goes wrong on their trip. 
These problems can range from lost baggage to flight delays to medical problems. The more someone spends on their trip, the more valuable travel insurance becomes. 
This is especially true for international trips and cruises, where travel problems could be quite expensive to solve. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic has become a norm, many travel insurance plans are considering including epidemic-related covered reasons.
Specifically, one tour & travel company is offering COVID-19 related coverage in addition to their existing travel insurance plan. 
The company wants to know which customers would be interested in buying it based on its database history. 

In this project, we will use the dataset provided by the company and aim to predict whether someone will purchase travel insurance based on various factors. 
We will also provide some suggestions in the end so that the company can conduct further research and improve upon our model.
